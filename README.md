## **About**

The Sauro project is an academic work developed in C language, which aims to simulate a system that can serve an educational institution so that it can intuitively register courses and students.

## **Feature**

The system is capable of performing CRUD operations for courses and students, and this functionality is restricted only to the administrator.

If the user wants to access the system as a student, they can select the student option in the main menu and then, through their enrollment number, access all the registered information related to them.
